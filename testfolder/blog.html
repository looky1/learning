 <h1> blog post build</h1>
 
 <p> i am using this project to enhance my skills creating with using git and github </p>
 <p>once i am done fine tuning my skills with git and github i will attempt to turn this generic blog post build</p>
 <p>into a twitter clone, if i am happy with my clone i will then try to make a full fledged app</p>
 <p>baby steps though, first this simple blog post, i am a second year IT student specializing in software dev</p>
 <p>college doesnt seem to be teaching me everything i feel i need to know to even be remotely successful in this field</p>
 <p>every video i watch leads to another the more i learn the less i know, because there are so many important concepts that i just have surface level understanding off</p>
 <p>adding stuff to check git status if everything is working</p>
